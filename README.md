# GREEN-VOID
2D Space Shooter Demo Project.
This is a demo of my Unity 2D project inspired by the classic NES space shooters. It was developed by me using C# programming.
All sprites were provided by Martin Avwenagha.
It features nice 2D visuals, weapon pickup system, enemy pathfinder, wave spawner and more. 
This project is not to be sold or to be used for ANY commercial purpose.
It is meant for demonstration purpose only. Maybe in the future it will become a complete game.
